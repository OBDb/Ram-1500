    description: "The fourth-generation Ram 1500 was introduced at the 2008 North American International Auto Show in Detroit and launched as the 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 in Fall 2008. This generation marked a pivotal transition, with Ram separated from Dodge starting in 2010 for the 2011 model year. The fourth generation featured a distinctive coil-spring five-link rear suspension—the first traditional full-size pickup truck with rear coil springs since 1972—replacing leaf springs and significantly improving ride comfort and handling. Engine options included the 3.7L PowerTech V6, 4.7L PowerTech V8, and 5.7L HEMI V8. Notable features included the RamBox cargo management system, Uconnect infotainment with available navigation, and available air suspension. Various trim levels ranged from the work-oriented Tradesman to the luxury-focused Laramie Limited and off-road specialized Power Wagon. This generation was produced at Warren Truck Assembly in Michigan and Saltillo Truck Assembly in Mexico, and was sold as both the Dodge Ram (2009-2010) and Ram 1500 (2011-2012)."

    description: "The 2013 model year brought a significant refresh to the fourth-generation Ram 1500, featuring a new front fascia, optional projector-beam halogen headlamps with LED turn signals/parking lamps, and a completely restyled interior that replaced the 'DODGE' dashboard badge with 'RAM'. The engine lineup was updated with the introduction of Chrysler's 3.6L Pentastar V6 coupled to the new ZF 8-speed TorqueFlite automatic transmission, achieving best-in-class fuel efficiency. The 4.7L V8 replaced the 3.7L V6 as the base engine, while the 5.7L HEMI V8 gained 5 horsepower through a new electric power steering system. New infotainment options included the Uconnect 5.0BT and top-of-the-line Uconnect ACCESS 8.4A/8.4AN with 8.4-inch touchscreens, GPS navigation, and mobile app compatibility. Air suspension became available offering four ride height settings, and the Ram became the first North American pickup truck to offer keyless ignition. The High Fuel Efficiency (HFE) model was introduced for 2013, offering 18/25 MPG with the Pentastar V6 and eight-speed transmission on 2WD regular cab configurations. This generation continued production through 2018 before being replaced by the Ram 1500 Classic (2019-2024) and the all-new fifth-generation platform."

    description: "The fifth-generation Ram 1500 (codenamed DT) debuted at the 2018 North American International Auto Show and began sales in early 2019 as a 2019 model year vehicle. This comprehensive redesign focused on weight reduction (approximately 225 pounds less than the previous generation), increased capability, and advanced technology. The frame utilizes 98% high-strength steel for improved rigidity and durability, with additional weight savings through aluminum components including the tailgate, engine mounts, and suspension parts. Engine options include the 3.6L Pentastar V6 with optional eTorque mild hybrid system, the 5.7L HEMI V8 with or without eTorque, and the 3.0L EcoDiesel V6. The interior features available 12-inch vertical touchscreen infotainment, active noise cancellation, premium audio systems, and luxury appointments rivaling premium sedans. The five-link rear coil suspension was further refined with available air suspension providing automatic load leveling and height adjustment. Advanced driver assistance features include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, and 360-degree camera systems. The high-performance Ram TRX model, introduced for 2021, targets the off-road performance market with a supercharged 6.2L HEMI V8 producing 702 horsepower, Bilstein adaptive dampers, 35-inch tires, and 13 inches of wheel travel. The fifth-generation Ram 1500 has won Motor Trend Truck of the Year a record four consecutive times (2019, 2020, 2021, and 2025)."
