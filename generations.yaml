    description: "The fourth-generation Ram 1500 was introduced at the 2008 North American International Auto Show in Detroit and launched as the 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 in Fall 2008. This generation marked a pivotal transition, with Ram separated from Dodge starting in 2010 for the 2011 model year. The fourth generation featured a distinctive coil-spring five-link rear suspension—the first traditional full-size pickup truck with rear coil springs since 1972—replacing leaf springs and significantly improving ride comfort and handling. Engine options included the 3.7L PowerTech V6, 4.7L PowerTech V8, and 5.7L HEMI V8, with the 3.0L EcoDiesel V6 added in 2014. Notable features included the RamBox cargo management system, Uconnect infotainment with available navigation, and available air suspension. Various trim levels ranged from the work-oriented Tradesman to the luxury-focused Laramie Limited and off-road specialized Power Wagon. The 2013 model year saw a significant refresh with restyled exterior and interior, new 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine, and ZF 8-speed automatic transmission. This generation was produced at Warren Truck Assembly in Michigan and Saltillo Truck Assembly in Mexico, and was sold as both the Dodge Ram (2009-2010) and Ram 1500 (2011-2018) before being replaced by the Ram 1500 Classic (2019-2024) and the all-new fifth-generation platform."

    description: "The fifth-generation Ram 1500 (codenamed DT) debuted at the 2018 North American International Auto Show and began sales in early 2019 as a 2019 model year vehicle. This comprehensive redesign focused on weight reduction (approximately 225 pounds less than the previous generation), increased capability, and advanced technology. The frame utilizes 98% high-strength steel for improved rigidity and durability, with additional weight savings through aluminum components including the tailgate, engine mounts, and suspension parts. Engine options include the 3.6L Pentastar V6 with optional eTorque mild hybrid system, the 5.7L HEMI V8 with or without eTorque, the 3.0L EcoDiesel V6, and later a supercharged 6.2L HEMI V8 in the high-performance Ram TRX model producing 702 horsepower. For the 2025 model year, the Hemi was temporarily replaced by the new 3.0L turbocharged Hurricane inline-six engine. The interior features available 12-inch vertical touchscreen infotainment, active noise cancellation, premium audio systems, and luxury appointments rivaling premium sedans. The five-link rear coil suspension was further refined with available air suspension providing automatic load leveling and height adjustment. Advanced driver assistance features include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, and 360-degree camera systems. The Ram TRX model, introduced for 2021, targets the off-road performance market with Hellcat power, Bilstein adaptive dampers, 35-inch tires, and 13 inches of wheel travel. The fifth-generation Ram 1500 has won Motor Trend Truck of the Year a record four consecutive times (2019, 2020, 2021, and 2025)."
